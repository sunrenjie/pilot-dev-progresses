<h2>Further development of the walrus project</h2>

<h3>Preliminaries</h3>

<p>Walrus (project homepage: <a href= "http://sourceforge.net/projects/walruscms/">
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/walruscms/</a>)
    is a CMS application written in Java. While it has many interesting features, it is now
    considerable outdated. Our further development here shall try to bring the project
    up-to-date to reflect state-of-art technologies.</p>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>bug-201506-24-1-improved-compatibility-and-dependency</h4>

        <p>The latest (1.5.0) software could be improved in terms of compatibility and
            dependency in many aspects:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The latest 1.5.0 walrus app does not work in the login portal url is
                    '/cms/login', but we prefer relative urls than absolute ones such that they are
                    really 'portable'. Also, deployment methods evolved from jetty 7 to 9; we'd
                    like walrus to be compatible with them all as much as possible.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Also, walrus is dependent on many modules not found on common maven
                    repositories. This makes it impossible to build without much effort on building
                    customized maven proxy servers, etc. We'd like to remove such dependencies as
                    much as possible.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>The directory holding the uploaded files shall be defined more
                    reasonably.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>bug-201506-24-2-i18n</h4>

        <p>The internationalization is incomplete and not clean; we shall fix that.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>bug-201506-24-3-code-clean-up</h4>

        <p>The code shall be cleaned up in may ways:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The usages of google services.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>bug-201506-24-4-doc-building</h4>

        <p>Building of HTML user guide from docbkx doc shall be fixed and made available as
            maven commands; all .xml files are already there.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>bug-201506-24-5-db-support</h4>

        <p>Support of databases is near to complete; yet it shall be made complete and easy
            to use.</p>
