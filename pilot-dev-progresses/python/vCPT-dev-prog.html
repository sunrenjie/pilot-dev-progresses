<h3>Blueprints for the vCPT project</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201503-1-predefine-metrics-filter-sets] [priority: low] To define customized sets of filters,
            extend command line argument handling to support that
            <span style="color:red">[20150512: abandoned because of little motivation to implement after
                bp-201503-3-track-perf-file-and-table-names is landed]</span></h4>

        <p>The existing way of describing filters is via command line argument. It was previously defined this
            way out of concern that the exact set of metrics to use may change too quickly and hard to keep track
            of at the core logic. Now it has grown a bit too complex, yet is still unable to meet our needs to
            customize. The main reason is that metrics involve too many aspects of factors: groups(cpu, mem, net,
            etc), names (usage, readIOSize, etc), units (number, kiloBytesPerSecond, etc), instances (vmnic0,
            vmnic1, etc), entity types (virtual machines, hosts) to be described easily at command line.</p>

        <p>After certain sets of metrics that are used frequently (or even routinely) are introduced to the
            library, user code that uses them have the benefits of</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Improved management and performance. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The perf db
        table name now can be well-defined without column digests.</span> UPDATE: due to possibly changing
                configurations (NICs, etc), we'd still need to compute column/metrics digest. We could store the
                table name in conf db (or somewhere else), and there will be no more need to search the sqlite3 perf
                db tables.</li>

            <li>Simplified command line argument handling.</li>

            <li>Ideally, we could even define together the common protocols for fetching and querying perf data;
                this way our code is better managed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The old mechanism of filtering via command line still proves useful and shall be maintained as
            before.</p>

        <h4>[bp-201503-2-uuid-without-hyphens] To remove hyphens from UUID strings <span style="color:red">
            [20150410: committed as 35678f and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>We use entity UUID to encode perf db table names, yet hyphen characters are not allowed in tables
            names. By removing the hyphens, the encoding process can be simpler.</p>

        <p>This change is trivial to implement: just change the UUID generator from str(uuid.uuid4()) to
            uuid.uuid4().hex.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201503-3-track-perf-file-and-table-names] <span style="color:red">[20150410: committed as
      ce4104 and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>Present idea is that perf data is stored in sqlite3 database files, organized with the help of file
            system. This arrangement has the benefits of better management and improved flexibility. Perf data
            essentially is periodic (typically per-day; to ease storing, querying, etc), per-entity type (entities
            of different types certainly have different perf metrics), per-entity (such that time can be primary
            key) This approach suffers from a number of shortcomings:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>As a performance optimization, we write SQL clauses for the perf data fetched from vCenter, while
                running a daemon that execute the file to yield db files. This way it is impossible to determine
                whether perf data for some entities is fetched, without help of other data structures. Shared
                storages across vCenter servers are especially affected: perf data for them may be repeatedly
                fetched.</li>

            <li>Due to the fact that metrics are not fixed, table names for the perf data are determined in terms
                of the metrics actually used. This way the file and table names are not directly available without
                searching.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The file and table names of perf data may be stored in (and correlated directly to) the conf db, or
            a meta-data sqlite3 db somewhere in perf directory. This BP is related to
            <strong>[bp-201503-1-predefine-metrics-filter-sets]</strong>, which will help further refine table
            names.</p>

        <p><strong>[Possibility of storing table names in sqlite3 DBMS]</strong> It is obvious that even with
            BP <strong>[bp-201503-1-predefine-metrics-filter-sets]</strong>, it is difficult to have perf metrics,
            and hence table names fixed, considering that the available NICs and other factors have to be
            determined in runtime and may subject to changes. A pragmatic approach will be to (still) encode
            metrics digest in table name, then store table names in a dedicated db. This db is related more to the
            perf data than to the config db, therefore, it shall be stored together with perf data, and hence in
            sqlite3 DBMS. The columns are well-defined, data size is minimal, therefore it is preferable to write
            to sqlite3 db files directly.</p>

        <p>The table name db shall be global to all vCenter servers such that perf data for cross-vCenter
            datastores can be managed in one place. Also, the db shall be sharded on per-entity type basis (for
            performance reasons only, AFAIK); this implies that entity type names shall be encoded in the db file
            names.</p>

        <p>Its columns may be entity-id (UUID), begin, until, (we could use these two to know whether some perf
            data has or has not been fetched), table-name. We won't store file names in the DB, though, as the perf
            data is stored in a per-day periods, the file names change periodically. We could not store that in a
            db whose records may cover for much larger a period.</p>

        <p>The fact that the number of tables and the table columns are well-defined suggests that we could use
            SQLAlchemy.</p>

        <p style="color:red;">Chances are that the BP
            <strong>[bp-201503-1-predefine-metrics-filter-sets]</strong> may be deprecated after this BP could
            finally solve our problems.</p>

        <p>[Update] Now that our model is based on SQLAlchemy, the actual impl. supports both sqlite3 and
            mysql.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201503-4-storing-perf-data-in-an-alternative-DBMS][priority: low]</h4>

        <p>The current approach of storing perf data in sqlite3 database file is too low-level. We must deal
            with two DBMS'es.</p>

        <p>We explored SQLAlchemy a bit for ideas, but could not come up with a clear clue. Currently we'd
            rather maintain the sqlite3 DBMS, leaving this BP as low priority.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201504-1-per-entity-type-perf-fetcher-app] <span style="color:red">[20150414: committed as
            6e130b2 and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>This BP shall develops an app based on the existing fetch-vcenter-configurations-and-perf-data.py
            that fetch perf data for entities of only a particular type. This reduces pressures on our
            metrics-filter command line description as we will only need to care about only a particular type.
            Chances are that this BP will leave BP <strong>[bp-201503-1-predefine-metrics-filter-sets]</strong>
            unnecessary.</p>

        <p>This bp is considered dependent on [bug-201504-3-vCenter-entity-type-name-strings-out-of-control];
            therefore, we delayed this bp until the latter is fixed.</p>

        <p>There is one choice that we shall make: while fetching perf data for one particular entity type, do
            we need to update config info for entities of other types? Doing so make the config db tables updated
            together as a whole, but may be unnecessary. One solution will be to leave the burden of updating the
            config db tables to a dedicated daemon running app fetch-vcenter-configurations.py.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201504-2-one-perf-dir-for-all-vCenter-servers] To merge per-vCenter perf data directories into
            one</h4>

        <p>For simplicity, previously we write perf data for different vCenter with different prefix (via
            external bash scripts). Yet, this will make it difficult to fetch/query perf data for datastores shared
            across vCenter servers. Until we could know whether a datastore has its perf data fetched elsewhere, we
            would have to fetch and store the same data twice.</p>

        <p>This BP shall remove those obstacles that stop us from keeping perf data together. Currently, the
            conf db is shared across vCenter servers, the abilities to disambiguate it provides is a good point to
            start. The remaining problems are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Simultaneous writing of perf data to db and plain sql text files shall be supported. While
                sqlite3 DBMS has the idea of transaction that allows safe shared access, the file system behind the
                sql text files may not. Therefore, we either introduce mutexes for accessing text files, or allow
                different chunks of sql text be written to different files that can still be collected and executed
                correctly by the app scan-perf-data-dir-and-execute-sql.py (after extension of course).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201504-3-actual-ranges-for-intervals] To define actual time ranges (aligned at boundaries) for
            which perf data is available for various intervals <span style="color:red">[20150405: impl. committed
      and merged to master as b96d8c1]</span></h4>

        <p>vCenter perf data is available at different intervals, past hour (realtime), past day, etc.
            Pragmatically, we could not fetch data exactly in such periods. For one thing, some data points may be
            mysteriously missing at the beginning and ending of the requested time ranges (due to vCenter bugs). On
            the other hand, due to unexpected delays in our program execution time, the periodic requests we make
            may lave gaps in the time line that can never be filled.</p>

        <p>Therefore, we shall fetch data in smaller ranges with endings aligned at specific boundaries, and
            for convenience, roughly half the size of the vCenter intervals: half hour for past hour, half day for
            past day, etc. The fetching frequency will double, but all beginning and ending time points will be at
            well-defined boundary, making perf data fetching/querying/processing easier in many aspects.</p>

        <p>This idea is already implemented in fetching realtime perf data: for every half hour, fetch real
            time perf data for the last half hour at half-hour boundary (plus small extensions on both ends to work
            around aforementioned bugs). But it is not yet feature-complete: in impl. of BP
            [bp-201503-3-track-perf-file-and-table-names] (which is dependent on this BP) , a mechanism is needed
            to tell from the perf index db that whether the current fetch is needed, or can be avoided. In
            addition, it seems good to generalize such idea to other intervals. Thus, in this BP, we will define
            explicitly the actual ranges we support for the various intervals.</p>
    </li>

        <h4>[bp-201504-14-4-app-query-db-for-hosts-and-VMs] <span style="color:red">[20150429: impl. committed
      and merged to master as 32a7f77]</span></h4>

        <p>We already have the query db apps for clusters, datastores, resource pools; we shall implement the
            rest for the sake of completeness.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201504-14-5-real-time-perf-data-for-datastores]</h4>

        <p>Our current implementation fails to fetch real time perf data for datastores, though obviously such
            data indeed exists according to vCenter.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201504-15-6-tracking-changing-of-config-db] [priority: high]</h4>

        <p>Change tracking has always been one of the trickiest topic in information management. For vCenter
            server, this may include host CPU/memory changes (degradation due to hardware failure, or change of
            configuration by human), virtual machine CPU/memory changes (scaling, etc). Without precise tracking of
            the entity configurations, the perf data is very difficult if possible to interpret.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201504-15-7-pilot-perf-data-querying-app] [priority: very high] <span style="color:red">
            [20150514: committed as b4ecd32 and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>The perf data fetching code runs well. We shall land the querying code ASAP to provide feedback for
            the fetching code and other functionality alike.</p>

        <p>Update: this bp is dependent on fix for
            <strong>[bug-201504-17-10-perf-db-table-names-begin-with-number]</strong>, which shall define table
            name construction as code shared by both fetching and querying code.</p>

        <p>In this bp, we may implement apps for hosts and virtual machines.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201505-06-1-PerfSqlite3Manager-enhancements] <span style="color:red">[20150512: fix committed
      as 5675544 and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>During working on [bp-201504-15-7-perf-data-querying-app], it is obvious that this class needs at
            least these improvements:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Functions like get_day_string_from_datetime() and get_full_time_from_datetime() shall be renamed
                to reflect their purposes instead of implementations.</li>

            <li>Entity type, instead of entity shall be accepted as parameter to __init__(). The perf querying
                code does not connect to vCenter and cannot get MOB entities easily. The change is easy to made since
                this class uses entities only to derive entity types to construct path for the db files.</li>

            <li>Filters id shall be removed from parameters to __init__(). Instead, all get_perf_data* functions
                requires filters id as an additional parameter. This change is because we may request multiple paths
                for multiple filter ids. Having one perf manager object for one request seems awkward.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The functions related to perf data querying shall be introduced along with the usages.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201505-06-2-argument-parsing-extension] <span style="color:red">[20150512: fix committed as
      ba2b6f3 and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>Apps developed in [bp-201504-15-7-perf-data-querying-app] needs additional arguments
            time-range(begin/until), data prefix, while arguments used to connect to vCenter server shall be
            removed. This suggests that some refactoring.</p>
    </li>

        <h4>[bp-201505-06-3-dedicated-timeutils] <span style="color:red">[20150512: fix committed as 4594e6b
      and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>As new features are landed, more and more time-related functionality are implemented and can
            potentially be shared.</p>

<h3>BUGs for the vCPT project</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>[bug-201504-1-no-obsoleting-old-entries] <span style="color:red">[20150403: fix committed as
      95b785c and merged to master]</span></h4>Needed thorough understanding of how the changing of ID of the
        entities affect our system, the perf data availability, etc. Before that, the apps shall not do that.
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bug-201504-2-to-disable-MOB-IDs-for-datastores] <span style="color:red">[20150403: fix committed
      as 4b52a45 and merged to master]</span></h4>Datastore MOB IDs change from one vCenter server to
        another. Therefore, the MO IDs shall be removed from invariants for entities shared across vCenter
        servers. Presently, those affected are datastores.
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bug-201504-3-vCenter-entity-type-name-strings-out-of-control] <span style="color:red">[20150410:
      fix committed as e239ea and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>The direct usage of vCenter entity type names in the codebase has grown more and more ubiquitous.
            From the practice of programming point of view, repeated usage of strings suggest that they shall be
            defined with dedicated names. This bug entry shall impl. such definitions.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bug-201504-4-considerable-old-code] [priority: medium]</h4>

        <p>This bug is filed to address the code obsoleted by new directions. For example, some apps are for
            old workflows. While we may use the old code sometime, we shall at least make such details well
            documented.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bug-201504-5-incorrect-Hz-conversion] <span style="color:red">[20150414: committed as 29650ab and
      merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>Previously, we thought 1GHz = 1024MHz, just as 1GB = 1024MB; but this turns out to be wrong.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bug-201504-6-chaotic-time-zone-usages] <span style="color:red">[20150414: committed as be4c91e and
      merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>Currently, the usages of time zone is rather arbitrary. Appropriate guide lines are needed. Old app
            fetch-perf-data-by-entity-type.py (and its dependent code) shall be kept as is. We just want it to work
            as before.</p>

        <p>[Implementation notes] The core library part now uses vCenter server time (with time zone set to
            GMT) exclusively. Now the user land app may be implemented with time zone in mind.&lt;/&gt;</p>

      committed as 2f2d068 and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>MO IDs are generated by str(entity) for simplicity, but that will leave surrounding apostrophes
            (single quotes) in the string. We'd better remove them.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bug-201504-15-8-multiple-cpu-models-in-clusters] [priority: high]</h4>

        <p>Different CPUs may be installed on different hosts in the same cluster. For example, while generally
            not recommended, AMD and Intel CPUs may co-exist. Our current implementation is to store only one
            model. If there are multiple models, select one randomly. The key part may be that, we need the exact
            CPU configuration of the host running the virtual machine, in order to interpret the perf data a bit
            more precisely.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bug-201504-17-9-db-lock-failure] [priority: high] <span style="color:red">[20150417: committed as
      03c94f6 and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>While four copies of app fetch-vcenter-configurations-and-perf-data-by-entity-type.py are running on
            behalf of the four vCenter servers, sometimes the error 'Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting
            transaction' occurs on the config db. The cause turns out to be that we do not commit db sessions fast
            enough. After session.add() is called until the calling of session.commit(), the db record
            create/update/delete requests are pending at the db. Other requests have to wait for the pending
            requests to be persisted to the db, in order to gain the lock and proceed. After waiting for a period
            longer than a predefined value, the error appears.</p>

        <p>Previously, we delay commit() as much as possible in the (not necessarily realistic) hope of better
            performance. Now we shall commit whenever a request is made to the db at session.flush() (possibly at
            calling session.add(), if autoflush defaults to True).</p>
    </li>

      committed as 553168d and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>The bug is introduced in the initial implementation of perf index db, in which table names are
            simplified, which turned out to be an over-simplification. Now we shall prefix the table name with some
            well-defined non-number characters. Possible candidates are fixed strings maybe as simple as '_', or
            variable ones like entity types. The former is preferred, since it is the simplest and, actually, no
            other kinds of info may prove useful here.</p>

        <p>The table construction is better defined as shared by fetching/querying code.</p>

        <h4>[bug-201505-06-01-refine-variants-and-mutables-for-hosts] <span style="color:red">[20150512:
      committed as e31bd34 and merged to master]</span></h4>

        <p>Previously, host CPU frequency is listed as invariants, as it is believed to remain the same as long
            as the CPU configuration does not change. But such change (by very small a quantity) is already
            observed, even when the CPU model, etc do not change. We shall relax the protection by invariants and
            take cpu frequency from invariants to mutables. On the other hand, the number of CPU cores may change
            during the hardware maintenance cycle. They are previously listed as mutables, now we consider it
            better defined as invariants, since hardware configuration change is one of the types of changes that
            we wish to track.</p>

        <p>While computing id (actually md5 digest) for the metrics, we typically sort the columns such that
            the id does not change even if vCenter reorders the columns. Yet incorrectly-performed sorting
            resulting in wrong columns and hence data interpretation.</p>

        <p>Metric filters, if not specified in command line argument, defaults to None. Yet None argument to
            hashlib.md5() will raise TypeError exception. The BP [bp-201505-06-2-argument-parsing-extension] shall
            define filters to default to '' if it is not specified, as a part of feature completeness effort. This
            bug targets shall default function argument, etc.</p>

        <h4>[bug-201505-21-4-obsoleting-old-entries-if-possible]</h4>

        <p>We shall mark entries that are old enough as obsoleted.</p>

        <p>For now, the obsoleting is performed by the fetch-vcenter-configurations*.py apps. Essentially, one
            app fetch time from the vCenter server on behalf of which it is running, determine the time point, then
            obsolete all entries of all vCenter servers older than that time. This seems a bit ugly. But consider
            that in typical setup, all vCenter servers are configured to sync with the same NTP server; they can be
            considered to share time. Therefore, we don't consider such practice a great problem.</p>

        <h4>[bug-201505-21-5-accumulated-code-nits-update]</h4>

        <p>There are plenty of nits that invites update: code that does not conform to PEP8, innocent yet ugly
            coding, dead code, unused imports, outdated entries requirements.txt, obsoleted TODOs, comments that
            disagree with code, etc.</p>

    <li>
        <h4>[bug-201505-22-6-obsoleted-config-db-entries-cannot-be-reused]</h4>

        <p>Presently, obsoleted config db entries cannot be re-picked up to use, as sync_into_session() never
            considers obsolete entries. This behavior contradicts with the design of the db record life cycle. The
            direct consequence is that the number of obsoleted entries will only irreversibly grow, or even double
            (e.g., on vCenter server and/or network failure). By re-using obsoleted entries, we essentially could
            tolerate unexpected consequences in the obsoleting code: if some entries are obsoleted yet should not
            have been, the re-picking up will simply reverse it.</p>
