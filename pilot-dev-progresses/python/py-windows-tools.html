<h3>Blueprints</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201507-09-1-using-utf8-exclusively]</h4>

        <p>I/O with non-ASCII (Chinese in our case) can be daunting for Python 2. During the initial development, we
            used GBK during the desperate effort of getting the code work. But, in order to make our life easier,
            we shall abandon such approach and use UTF-8 exclusively. One good news is that the project ztb-crawler has
            already made good progress, we may borrow idea and code from there.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201507-09-2-allow-reading-from-event-log-file]</h4>

        <p>There is no reason to restrict us to read from the Windows event log system only. The ability to read from
            log file can make testing easier, among other benefits.</p>

        <p>The bp is dependent on <span>[bp-201507-09-1-using-utf8-exclusively]</span>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201507-10-3-faulty-management-for-blocked-ip-time-stamp]</h4>

        <p>The current stamp management for the suspects is just quick-and-dirty, plus being buggy. It suggests a
            complete overhaul.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201507-10-4-complete-life-cycle-for-the-IPs</h4>

        <p>Currently, IPs can find their way to the suspect list and prisoner list (firewall black-list), but there is
            yet no way out. There are cases when we wish to release some outdated or all suspects/prisoners (to clean
            up, for example).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201507-10-5-break-up-the-code]</h4>

        <p>The program has grown from a humble script to a giant beast. It is time to break it up and get things
            cleaned up.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>[bp-201507-10-6-testing-code-needed]</h4>

        <p>We are in desperate need for that.</p>
